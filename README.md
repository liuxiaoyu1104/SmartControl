<!-- ## Introduction -->

For handling the disagreements between the text prompts and rough visual conditions, we propose a novel text-to-image generation method dubbed SmartControl, which is designed to align well with the text prompts while adaptively keeping useful information from the visual conditions. Specifically, we introduce a control scale predictor to identify conflict regions between the text prompt and visual condition and predict spatial adaptive scale based on the degree of conflict. The predicted control scale is employed to adaptively integrate the information from rough conditions and text prompts to achieve the flexible generation.

## How to Use


- If you are interested in SmartControl, you can refer to [**smartcontrol_demo**](smartcontrol_demo.ipynb)


- For integration our SmartControl to IP-Adapter, please download the IP-Adapter models and refer to [**smartcontrol_ipadapter_demo**](smartcontrol_ipadapter_demo.ipynb)

    ```
    # download IP-Adapter models
    cd SmartControl
    git lfs install
    git clone https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter
    mv IP-Adapter/models models
    ```
